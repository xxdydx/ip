# Lyra

> "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." â€“ David Allen ([source](https://gettingthingsdone.com/))

**Lyra** frees your mind of having to remember things you need to do. It's:

- **text-based**
- *easy to learn*
- ~~FAST~~ **SUPER FAST** to use

All you need to do is:

1. download it from [here](https://github.com/yourusername/ip/releases)
2. double-click it
3. add your tasks
4. let it manage your tasks for you ðŸ˜‰

And it is **FREE**!

## Features

- [x] Managing tasks
- [x] Managing deadlines
- [x] Managing events
- [ ] Reminders (coming soon)
- [ ] Data persistence
- [ ] Search functionality

If you are a Java programmer, you can use it to practice Java too. Here's the main method:

```java
public class Lyra {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Lyra lyra = new Lyra();
        lyra.run();
    }
}
```

## Setting up in IntelliJ

**Prerequisites:** JDK 17, update IntelliJ to the most recent version.

1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
2. Open the project into IntelliJ as follows:
   1. Click `Open`
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults
3. Configure the project to use **JDK 17** (not other versions) as explained [here](https://jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk)<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option
4. After that, locate the `src/main/java/lyra/Lyra.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Lyra.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:

```
Hello from
 ____        _        
|  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
| | | | | | | |/ / _ \
| |_| | |_| |   <  __/
|____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
```

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.

## Usage

To use Lyra, simply run the application and type commands like:

- `todo buy groceries` - adds a new todo task
- `deadline submit report /by 2024-12-31` - adds a deadline task
- `event team meeting /at 2024-12-25 14:00` - adds an event task
- `list` - shows all tasks
- `mark 1` - marks task 1 as done
- `unmark 1` - marks task 1 as not done
- `delete 1` - deletes task 1
- `find meeting` - searches for tasks containing "meeting"
- `bye` - exits the application
